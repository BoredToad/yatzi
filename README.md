you can have 0 players if you just press enter
you HAVE to specify number of bots, which can be 0
try watching a few hundred bots fight it out (kinda schmexy)

The bots are written in a really simple way, so they can't
think longterm and often just put the first thing they get in chance
as it offers the most points then and there
